# Dice-Simulator
### Python Script

To simulate a dice roll with Python, We will be using the random module in Python. The random module can be imported easily into your code as it is preinstalled in the Python programming language. 

After importing the random module, you have access to all the functions included in the module. It’s a pretty long list, but for our purposes, we’ll use the random.randint() function. This function returns a random integer based on the start and end we specify.

The Dice Roll Simulation can be done by choosing a random integer between 1 and 6 for which we can use the random module in the Python programming language.

### For GUI Dice Script

Logic will be same and the tkinter gui modules will be used here.

For the dice roll simulation program to run successfully and for building up GUI, you must import the python tkinter library.

### Module not found solution

If its not already installed on your system then use the pip package manager and type the following :
