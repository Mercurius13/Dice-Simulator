# Dice-Simulator
### Python Script

To simulate a dice roll with Python, We will be using the random module in Python. The random module can be imported easily into your code as it is preinstalled in the Python programming language. 

After importing the random module, you have access to all the functions included in the module. It’s a pretty long list, but for our purposes, we’ll use the random.randint() function. This function returns a random integer based on the start and end we specify.
